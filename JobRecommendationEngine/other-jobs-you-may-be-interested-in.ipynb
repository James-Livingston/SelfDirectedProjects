    "### Using Natural Language Processing to Find Similar Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this approach is to ensure a job seeker is aware of other jobs that they may be interested in.  Similar to an online retailer who displays similar items for sale, we will display similar jobs available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this will increase the number of applicants the City of Los Angeles receives.  This will also aid applicants in navigating what may be thousands of available positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Results\n",
    "\n",
    "As this process finds similar jobs, here are a few examples demonstrating the value:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Job | Similar Job |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| MEDICAL ASSISTANT | LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE |\n",
    "| PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT | DEPARTMENTAL CHIEF ACCOUNTANT |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is to use natual language processing (NLP) methods to compare the job description of all provided jobs.  We will use term frequency–inverse document frequency to represent a job description as a numeric vector.  Then, we will compare each vector to all other vectors using cosine similarity.  The result will be an \"rating\" of how similar job descriptions are to one another.  Finally, we will filter those \"ratings\" for the highest value, which will represent the most similar job description."
